	<p> 
		Bacteria are tenacious creatures.  They are found nearly everywhere, including inside of our bodies.  
		The bulk of our bacteria live in the large intestine, where they interact with each other and with the rest of our body, playing important roles in our development and well being.
		Despite their immense importance to human health, the lives of these microbes inside of the gut are still extremely mysterious.
		This is because it's difficult to directly observe bacteria in the gut.

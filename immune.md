# Immune system sensing of gut bacteria

Resident bacterial populations within the intestine are highly dynamic, both in terms of spatial organization and abundances (see [here]({% link spatial.md %}) and [here]({% link models.md %})). How precisely do animals sense these dynamic changes occuring in their intestines? Being able to read out subtle and fast changes in bacterial behaviors would provide hosts with valuable information about ongoings in the gut, which is effectively an interface between an animal and its environment. Conversely, high sensitivity to microbial activities might pose a risk of persistant inflammation that would be detrimental to the host. To this point, misregulation of intestinal immune responses to gut microbes is thought to underly a variety of diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.

We have begun to invesitage these processes using larval zebrafish as model that enables spatially-resolved observation of both bacterial and host immune dynamics through live imaging (see [here]()). On the host side, we make use of transgenic zebrafish engineered with fluorescent reporters immune cell activities. In particular, we use a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter of gene expression of the canonical pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF&#945;. On the bacteria side, we use gnotobiotic techniques to raise fish devoid of any microbes and then study individual bacterial species and how they interact with the host immune system. We recently characterized a zebrafish gut bacterial isolate that, while being a common member of the conventional zebrafish gut microbiota and not causing overt disease, stimulates immune activity in a manner dependent of its swimming behavior [1]. 



Swimming motility enables bacteria to access space close to intestinal epithelium, where their pro-inflammatory molecues are more easily sensed by immune cells.

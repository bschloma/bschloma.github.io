title: Spatial organization of gut bacteria
---

It is now apparent that the bacteria in our intestines play important roles in a variety of health and disease related processes, but what do they actually do in there? Do they grow in colonies like they do in the lab? Do they stick to things? Do they swim? What happens to bacteria during peristalsis? Are there general, biophysical principles governing the spatial organization of gut bacteria? In addition to feeding our curiosity about life in the microbial world, these questions are central to determining whether our resident microflora help or hurt us. Because of the high density of microbes in the gut, spatial structure is likely an important driver of the population dynamics that ultimately determine which bacterial species dominate. In addition, the location of bacteria in the gut is thought to impact how their chemical signals are processed and interpreted by the body. For example, bacteria that can access space close to the epithelial boundary of the intestine likely  have their signals heard "louder" than cells confined to the hollow center of the gut. 


To probe the spatial organization of gut bacteria, we use naturally transparent larval zebrafish as a model vertebrate host that enables live imaging experiments in which we directly watch bacteria in living animals.

Thanks to [recently developed genetic tools](https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/5/e01877-18), bacteria native to the zebrafish intestine can be engineered with fluorescent tags and imaged with fluorescence microscopy. We use a technique called [light sheet fluorescence microscopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527417301376?via%3Dihub) to rapidly image the full 3D volume of the larval zebrafish intestine (~1mm long) with minimal photodamage. Finally, [established gnotobiotic techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091679X16301571?via%3Dihub) allow us to derive animals germ-free, or devoid of any microbes, and then add back in particular bacterial species to study controlled, model microbial communities.


This approach has led to a number of important and unexpected insights regarding the spatial organization of gut bacteria. Conventionally, resident gut bacteria are depicted as adherent, biofilm-like populations growing in the dense mucus layer adjacent to the intestinal epithelium. This notion of adherence is thought to underlie the stability of commensal bacteria. In our surveys of over 10 different strains of zebrafish gut bacteria, we have found few examples of such populations. Instead, we find that gut bacterial populations are dominated by 3D aggregates that are suspended within intestinal fluid in the center of the gut.

Image is a maximum intensity projection of a 3D image stack acquired with light sheet fluorescence microscopy. This particular bacterial species, a member of the *Enterobacter* genus, is commonly found in conventional zebrafish intestines and forms dense, multicellular aggregates in the gut of varying sizes.

These aggregates are subject to intestinal fluid flows and can be transported up and down the gut. Occasionally, large aggregates are expelled from the gut altogether.

However, due to a combination of retrograde flow and aggregate fragmentation, in which single cells break out of aggregates and form new clusters, these populations can stably colonize the intestine without the need for re-introduction from outside the gut. 

My work has focused largely on understanding the rules that govern spatial organization in this system. Remarkably, we find that robust, quantitative relationships emerge in several aspects of spatial structure. We find roughly power-law distributions of aggregate sizes in the gut, with the probability density function scaling approximately as ~(*size*)<sup>-2</sup> over several decades, and can understand the emergence of this scaling with a minimal model of bacterial cluster kinetics [1]. We also find  tight scaling relations between aggregation and localization along the length of the gut, both within and across species [2]. These findings indicate that biophysical processes are important for understanding the spatial organization of gut bacteria, and that it is possible to understand these important systems through general, quantitative relationships.

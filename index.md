# Welcome!

My name is Brandon Schlomann, I am a physics PhD candidate in the lab of [Dr. Raghuveer Parthasarathy](https://pages.uoregon.edu/raghu/) at the University of Oregon. I am generally interested in simple, quantitative relationships that emerge in complex biological systems. This phenomenon is fascinating from a physics perspective and is often important for biological function. My PhD work focuses on gut microbiomes---vast communities of bacteria and other microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals. I use advanced microscopy techniques, such as [light sheet fluorescence microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_sheet_fluorescence_microscopy), to image bacteria within the intestines of live animals and study their behaviors. Combined with computational image analysis and physics-inspired quantitative theory, this approach has led to general insights into the spatial organization and dynamics of gut microbes. More information can be found on my [Research page]({% link research.md %}).

# Welcome!

My name is Brandon Schlomann, I am a physics PhD candidate in the lab of Dr. Raghuveer Parthasarathy at the University of Oregon. I am generally interested in simple, quantitative relationships that emerge in complex biological systems. This phenomenon is fascinating from a physics perspective and highlights the richness of systems far from equilibrium. Equally interesting is the fact that such relationships often determine biological function and therefore important for understanding and manipulating biological systems. My PhD work focuses on gut microbiomes---vast communities of bacteria and other microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals. I use advanced microscopy techniques, such as light sheet fluorescence microscopy, to image bacteria within the intestines of live animals and study their behaviors. Combined with computational image analysis and physics-inspired quantiative theory, this approach has led to insight into how the physics of bacterial growth and aggregation, coupled to intestinal fluid flows, determine the spatial organization and dynamics of gut microbial communities, their response to perturbations like antibiotics, and their pro-inflammatory nature.

My name is Brandon Schlomann, I am a James S. McDonnell postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Dr. Hernan Garcia](http://garcialab.berkeley.edu) at the University of California-Berkeley. I am a physicist studying interactions between microbes and the immune system. I use live imaging to peer inside animals and watch immune responses at the single-cell level. More information can be found on my [Research page]({% link research.md %}).

>This 3D rendering shows a fruit fly larvae launching an immune response to bacterial infection. Magenta shows cell membranes of a tissue called the fat body, which is a major immune organ in flies. Green is a reporter of the antimicrobial peptide Diptericin. Different cells respond differently to the infection. By analyzing images like this, we can understand how the behaviors of individual cells combine to create an organism-scale immune response. This image was taken with lightsheet fluorescence microscopy. The tissue shown is around 3 mm long.

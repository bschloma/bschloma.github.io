It is now apparent that the bacteria in our intestines play important roles in a variety of health and disease related processes, but what do they actually do in there? Do they grow in colonies like they do in the lab? Do they stick to things? Do they swim? What happens to bacteria during peristalsis? In addition to feeding our curiosity about life in the microbial world, these questions regarding the spatial organization of bacteria are central to determining whether our resident microflora help or hurt us. Because of the high density of microbes in the gut, spatial structure is likely an important driver of population dynamics that ultimately determine which bacterial species dominate. In addition, the location of bacteria in the gut is thought to impact how their chemical signals are processed and interpreted by the body. For example, bacteria that can access space close to the epithelial boundary of the intestine likely  have their signals heard "louder" than cells confined to hollow center of the gut.
